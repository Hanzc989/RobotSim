# RobotSim
Processing code for the robot simulator

## Requirements

The simulator requires the [Processing tool](https://processing.org/).

## Features

The simulator allows to test parametric moves for the quadrupede robot. The parameterization mirrors the [C++ implementation](https://github.com/ericleib/RobotCode) which runs embedded on the Arduino microcontroller that powers the quadrupede robot.

The simulator allows to tune 15 different parameters in real time, allowing to test and optimize a wide variety of manoeuvers and gaits. It is also possible to simulate pre-coded sequences of moves, with continuous interpolation between them (to ensure smooth execution on the actual robot).
